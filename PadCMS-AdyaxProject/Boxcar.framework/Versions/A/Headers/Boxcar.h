/**
 Boxcar is a singleton that encapsulate interface to Boxcar Push Platform.
 
 @copyright ProcessOne Â© 2012-2013
 
 The framework integrates two types of push notifications:
 1. Full support for *Apple Push Notification Service* (APNS).
 2. *InApp push*, which is a a push system that does not get through Apple Push. Its main advantage is that it does not requires the user to approve the reception of push messages through Apple mechanism. As such it can be fully used as a way to keep a realtime communication channel between Boxcar server and the application itself. The drawback is that it will only work while the application is running. This means that you also need to implement APNS as well if you want to notify the user after the 10 minutes the application is allowed to run in background.

 Using this class should be enough to fully control Push Service from your application.
